AURA AI LICENSE AGREEMENT
Version 1.0, 25 MAY 2024

Copyright (c) 2024 Adaptive Unified Recursive Algorithm (AURA AI) and Nexora AI

Section I: PREAMBLE
Large generative models are increasingly adopted and have the potential to transform how individuals interact with AI and ML technologies.

While these technologies offer great societal benefits, concerns remain regarding misuse, due to technical limitations or ethical considerations.

This License aims to balance openness with responsible downstream use of the accompanying model. Inspired by permissive open-source licenses for intellectual property rights, it also introduces use-based restrictions prohibiting certain specific uses to allow the licensor to enforce the license and prevent misuse.

Downstream derivatives of the model may be released under different licenses, but must include at least the same use-based restrictions as set forth here. This License promotes open and responsible research on generative models for content generation.

This License governs the use of the model and its derivatives, informed by the model card associated with the model.

NOW THEREFORE, You and AURA AI and Nexora AI agree as follows:

1. Definitions
License: Terms and conditions for use, reproduction, and distribution as defined in this document.

Data: Information or content extracted from the dataset used to train, pretrain, or evaluate the Model. The Data is not licensed under this License.

Output: Informational content resulting from operating the Model.

Model: Machine-learning assemblies (including checkpoints), with learned weights and parameters trained or tuned using the Data and Complementary Material.

Derivatives of the Model: Modifications or models created by transferring patterns from the Model to another model, including but not limited to distillation or synthetic data generation techniques.

Complementary Material: Source code, scripts, documentation, tutorials, or examples accompanying the Model for running, training, or evaluating it.

Distribution: Sharing, reproducing, publishing, or hosting the Model or its Derivatives to third parties, including as hosted services (e.g., APIs, web access).

AURA AI: Adaptive Unified Recursive Algorithm and its parent entity Nexora AI, including affiliates.

You: Any individual or legal entity exercising permissions under this License or using the Model in any capacity.

Third Parties: Individuals or entities not under common control with AURA AI or You.

Section II: INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS
Both copyright and patent rights apply to the Model, Derivatives, and Complementary Material. Additional terms are in Section III.

2. Copyright License Grant
AURA AI grants You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable license to reproduce, publicly display, perform, sublicense, and distribute the Complementary Material, the Model, and its Derivatives.

3. Patent License Grant
AURA AI grants You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable license to make, use, sell, and import the Model and Complementary Material, limited to patent claims licensable by AURA AI that are infringed by its contributions. If You initiate patent litigation alleging infringement of the Model or Complementary Material, this patent license terminates immediately.

Section III: CONDITIONS OF USAGE, DISTRIBUTION AND REDISTRIBUTION
4. Distribution and Redistribution
You may distribute or host the Model or its Derivatives, modified or not, under the conditions that:
a) Use-based restrictions in paragraph 5 are included in any legal agreement governing use and distribution, and notice of these restrictions is given to downstream users (this does not apply to Complementary Material).
b) Recipients receive a copy of this License.
c) Modified files carry prominent notices of changes.
d) All copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices are preserved unless irrelevant.
e) You may add your own copyright and license terms to your modifications or Derivatives, provided they comply with paragraph 4.a.

5. Use-based Restrictions
You may not use the Model or its Derivatives for the restricted purposes listed in Attachment A. All your users must comply with these restrictions. Permitted use includes lawful creation, fine-tuning, running, evaluating, or updating the Model.

6. Output Generated
AURA AI claims no rights to the Output You generate using the Model. You are solely responsible for the Output and its uses, which must comply with this License.

Section IV: OTHER PROVISIONS
7. Updates and Runtime Restrictions
AURA AI reserves the right to restrict usage of the Model remotely or otherwise, if used in violation of this License.

8. Trademarks
Nothing in this License grants You rights to use AURA AI or Nexora AI trademarks, trade names, logos, or suggest endorsement.

9. Personal Information and IP Rights
The Model may contain personal information and protected IP. You must comply with all applicable laws regarding such data and works. Use of the Model does not grant you any rights to process personal data or IP, and You assume all associated risks.

10. Disclaimer of Warranty
The Model and Complementary Material are provided "AS IS" without warranties, including but not limited to title, non-infringement, merchantability, or fitness for purpose. You bear all risks in use or redistribution.

11. Limitation of Liability
AURA AI is not liable for any damages arising from use or inability to use the Model or Complementary Material, except where required by law (e.g., deliberate or gross negligence).

12. Acceptance of Warranty or Liability
If You offer support, warranty, indemnity, or additional liability to others, You do so on Your own behalf and indemnify AURA AI from any claims arising from it.

13. Severability
If any part of this License is invalid or unenforceable, the rest remains in effect.

14. Governing Law and Jurisdiction
This License is governed by the laws of the People's Republic of China. The courts located in the domicile of Nexora AI’s Hangzhou office have exclusive jurisdiction.
